I've gotten in the habbit of re-working my website every year or so due to it 
not having one or more features. The features I want to show are generally to highlight
both my skill as a web developer and to make the website robust enough to write 
any type of page/tutorial/video/other. 

I plan to do what I have done before and build this website as a tutorial for 
other developers and myself to show all of th fetaures required in a modern CMS 
and blogging system. 

I hope to create a site that not only shows how to build a node.js blogging platform,
but is also robust enough to handle virtually unlimited traffic with minimal response time.
